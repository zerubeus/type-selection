Last Updated: 2025-01-28

This privacy policy describes how the Type Selection browser extension ("Extension") handles user data.

All data processing occurs locally within your browser. The Extension:

- Does not collect or store any personal information
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not track browsing history
- Does not share or sell any data to third parties
- Only activates when explicitly triggered by the user through the context menu

Data Storage

- No user data is permanently stored
- All session data is temporary and is cleared when the typing practice is completed
- All processing happens locally in your browser

Third-Party Access
The Extension does not share any data with third parties and operates completely offline.
